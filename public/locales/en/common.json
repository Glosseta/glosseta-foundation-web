    "whoWeAreProblemAtHandContent": "At this point of time there's too much misinformation and misrepresentation of what Web3 is and what it isn't.  From mainstream media reporting on every mishap, celebrities taking advantage of their unknowing fans and just people who flat out don't know what they're talking about.  On the other side of the coin, too much of today's documentation, educational oriented DAO's and communities are heavily developer oriented and for good reason as at this stage of web3 growth builders are needed more than ever.  Unfortunately, no one is deeply concentrating on how the rest of the globe is supposed to understand and take in Web3 and it's surrounding ecosystem in a manner that doesn't require a technical background to decipher.  What if there was an organization whose sole mission was to provide the most globally accessible, digestible Web3 educational content to be delivered in an open, localized, decentralized, transparent and community driven manner...",
